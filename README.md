Ever played concentration, a multi-player game where with every turn you flip over two cards to try to find its match. The player with the most matches at the end wins. Today, you're going to be building your own version!

## Let's Get Started

You'll be coding your solution in `css/style.css`. You'll want to have `index.html` open in both the browser and text editor, as well as `css/style.css` in the text editor.

You'll want to have the card flip when you hover your mouse over the card. The sprite you'll use is save in `images/cards.png`.

Don't forget to save your changes and refresh in the browser to check your work!
